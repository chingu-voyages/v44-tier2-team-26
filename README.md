# Boole Bots Game

Boole Bots is a game that is not only fun, but also an aid in helping to understand basic Boolean logic. This game has an arena of 8x8 game tiles in which your bots move at random speeds and trajectories. The Bots are assigned boolean values of 0 or 1 and boolean operations - AND, OR, NOR, NOT.
When a bot collides with another bot its boolean operation is applied to both it and the other bots' boolean value to determine which one wins or looses, or if the collision results in a tie. Loosing bots disappear and winning bots continue moving about the arena until only one remains.
The leaderboard will display the wins and losses of each bot. It will increment for a winning collision and decrement for a losing collision.
